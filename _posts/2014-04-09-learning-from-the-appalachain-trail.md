During the summer of 2012, I spent four months on the Appalachian Trail. As I look back on that experience, what stands out to me are not the encounters with moose and bears. Its not the impeccable nights spent on the White Mountains, and it isn't the run-ins with peculiar mountain men. What stands out now, two years later, is the incredible focus that the Appalachian Trail allowed.

Throughout those four months, I had a single goal: hike to Mt. Katahdin. This goal captivated and consumed me. Every action I took was focused on achieving it. When I went into a town to buy groceries, I counted the ounces for each purchase. Ensuring it wouldn't weigh me down. When I was going to sleep, I would read my maps and guide books to plan out the next day. When I ate, I would keep meals small, so I could immediately continue to hike. 

With this all-encompassing goal, everything became simple. When I woke up in the morning, I knew exactly what I was doing that day; I was walking. I never checked my calendar for meetings or appointments. I never debated whether it was more important to write this email or create that presentation. No, it was simple. I was walking, and if I wasn't walking, I was doing something so I could start walking again.

This simplicity was amplified by the lack of distractions to form an almost meditative state. There were no cell phones or emails to derail my train of thought. I was able to think deeply and clearly, and my mind was forced to wander and be creative. This thinking allowed me to develop some of my strongest opinions on topics from [trail building techniques](http://www.americantrails.org/resources/trailbuilding/) to [SLAM algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping).

When I was on the Appalachian Trail, this state of mind was easy to achieve. It was an artifact of my environment. However, since finishing my hike and starting my role at Microsoft, that is no longer the case. Now, I find myself struggling to achieve this same focus. While, I have not found a perfect formula, a couple concrete items that have helped me are:

**Set definitive goals** - I try to write down both long term (monthly) and short term (daily) goals. I make sure that I will be satisfied if this one goal is the only thing I achieve. These goals allow me to judge my progress and push myself toward a deadline. In addition, they provide a north star to prioritize validate my individual actions against. 

**Ensure each action has purpose** - I try to have a purpose for each of my actions. For example, prior to attending a meeting, I want to have a clear objective and reason for attending. In addition, I try to ensure each of these objectives help me achieve my broader goals mentioned above.

**Minimize distractions** - In my job, distractions are constant, and they kill my productivity, deep thinking, and creativity. A couple things I do to minimize distractions are:

* Set specific times of day to check and respond to emails. The vast majority of emails I get are not urgent and a response can wait a couple hours.

* Allow myself to be bored. For example, if I am waiting in a line, I try not to check the news on my phone. Instead, I allow my mind to wander and be creative.
